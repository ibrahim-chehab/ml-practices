# ML Practices

This repository contains exercises and examples demonstrating proficiency with key Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning. Each notebook covers a specific topic:

- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization exercises.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computation exercises.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis exercises.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning exercises.

## Notebooks
1. `matplotlib-exercises.ipynb`: Covers basic and advanced visualization techniques using Matplotlib.
2. `numpy-exercises.ipynb`: Demonstrates array manipulation, mathematical operations, and vectorization.
3. `pandas-exercises.ipynb`: Includes data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation tasks.
4. `scikit-learn-exercises.ipynb`: Focuses on building machine learning models, feature scaling, and model evaluation.

## How to Use
